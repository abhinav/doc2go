## v0.12.0 - 2025-12-08
### Added
- Links to documentation for third-party packages now include version references for the version of the third-party module in use. For links to https://pkg.go.dev, this is enabled without any changes. For link templates specified with `-pkg-doc`, new variables have been added to allow the equivalent: `{{.Module.Path}}`, `{{.Module.Version}}`, and `{{.Module.Subpath}}`. The new -no-mod-versions flag opts out of this functionality.
- Add '-C DIR' flag to change to the given directory before running similarly to the -C flag offered by go and git.
