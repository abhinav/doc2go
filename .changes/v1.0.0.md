## v1.0.0 - 2025-12-01
### Changed
- Use Go type analysis (via go/types) when analyzing source code instead of syntactic analysis (via go/ast) which was deprecated in Go 1.22. This improves accuracy with regards to which identifiers are rendered as links in generated HTML, covering many cases that were previously missed.
