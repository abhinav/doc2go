  Links to documentation for third-party packages now include
  version references for the version of the third-party module in use.
  For links to https://pkg.go.dev, this is enabled without any changes.
  For link templates specified with `-pkg-doc`,
  new variables have been added to allow the equivalent:
  `{{.Module.Path}}`, `{{.Module.Version}}`, and `{{.Module.Subpath}}`.
  The new -no-mod-versions flag opts out of this functionality.
