-highlight [MODE:][THEME]

MODE determines the method of highlighting used.
Valid values of MODE are:

  auto
	Decide automatically based on other flags.
	Uses 'inline' if -embed is set, and 'classes' otherwise.
  classes
	Highlighting is performed via CSS classes.
  inline
	Highlighting is performed via inline 'style' tags on elements.

MODE may be omitted, in which case it defaults to 'auto'.

THEME specifies the theme used for highlighting.
THEME may be omitted, in which case it defaults to '` + _defaultStyle.Name + `'.
Get a list of available themes with the following command:

	doc2go -highlight-list-themes

You can preview most themes at https://swapoff.org/chroma/playground/.
doc2go additionally includes a minimal 'plain' theme
if you prefer not to have significant syntax highlighting.

In 'classes' mode, the theme's stylesheet must be included in the page for
highlighting to work. This is done automatically if -embed is not set.
If -embed is set, this must be done manually.
Use the -highlight-print-css flag to access a theme's stylesheet.

	# Print the stylesheet for the default theme.
	doc2go -highlight-print-css

	# Print the stylesheet for a specific theme.
	doc2go -highlight-print-css -highlight=plain

Both MODE and THEME are optional.
If only one is specified, it's assumed to be the THEME.
Add a trailing ':' to specify the MODE and use the default theme.

	-highlight=plain    # == auto:plain
	-highlight=classes: # == classes:` + _defaultStyle.Name + `
	-highlight=inline:plain
