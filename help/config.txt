-config RC

RC is a configuration file.
By default, doc2go will try to read it from doc2go.rc, if present.

Configuration files have the format:

	option1 value1
	option2 value2
	# ...

* each line is an option name, a space, and then the value
* the option name must be a single word
* the option value is the rest of the line
* the '#' character starts a line comment

Nearly every doc2go flag may be supplied as an option.

For example:

	# start at module root
	home go.abhg.dev/doc2go

	# include internal packages in listings
	internal

	highlight inline:tango
