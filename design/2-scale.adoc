= Scalability

== Requirements

The tool should be able to generate documentation for very large repositories.
Memory usage needs should not increase too much for large repositories.
To aid in that goal, we should not use `go/packages`' NeedsSyntax mode,
as it loads the ASTs for all files in all packages into memory.
Instead, we should use it to find packages and then load them one at a time.

== Future work

In the future, we can introduce concurrency
so that a fixed number of workers
are loading and rendering these packages one at a time.
